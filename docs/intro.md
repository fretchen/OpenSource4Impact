Welcome to the *Open Source guideline for Development Cooperation projects*. We wish to provide hands-on guidance for designing and planning projects that **introduce or adapt existing open source software**. 

The guide is divided into three main parts:

## Introduction


    This part provides an overview of the guideline and essential terminology. It also introduces the three cases of open source software use in development cooperation projects.

## Pre-project IT selection


    This part provides a hands-on checklist for the preproject phase, where the project team is still in the process of defining the project and its requirements.

## Writing ToRs

    This part provides a checklist for the writing of Terms of Reference (ToRs) for the procurement and operation of open source software.
