## A first cost overview

In general we can divide the cost into four major categories:

- **Staff**: The staff includes the people working on the project like developers, testers, Q&A and others, their travel etc.
- **Hardware**: The hardware that is needed to get the whole project also running.
- **Administration**: Who is working behind the scences to get the non-technical questions resolved ?
- **Licences**: It is fairly likely that you will have some licence costs (working on open-source or not).

Then it is also helfpul to separate the costs into a first build and roll-out / run.

## Details on staff positions

In the following section we provide a more detailled list that might help you to estimate the initial costs of the build phase.
